(** {1 Lazy graph polymorphic data structure} *)

(** This module serves to represent directed graphs in a lazy fashion. Such
    a graph is always accessed from a given initial node (so only connected
    components can be represented by a single value of type ('v,'e) t).
    
    The default equality considered here is [(=)], and the default hash
    function is {! Hashtbl.hash}. *)

(** {2 LogtkType definitions} *)

type ('id, 'v, 'e) t = {
  eq : 'id -> 'id -> bool;
  hash : 'id -> int;
  force : 'id -> ('id, 'v, 'e) node;
} (** Lazy graph structure. Vertices, that have unique identifiers of type 'id,
      are annotated with values of type 'v, and edges are annotated by type 'e.
      A graph is a function that maps each identifier to a label and some edges to
      other vertices, or to Empty if the identifier is not part of the graph. *)
and ('id, 'v, 'e) node =
  | Empty
  | Node of 'id * 'v * ('e * 'id) Sequence.t
  (** A single node of the graph, with outgoing edges *)
and ('id, 'e) path = ('id * 'e * 'id) list
  (** A reverse path (from the last element of the path to the first). *)

(** {2 Basic constructors} *)

(** It is difficult to provide generic combinators to build graphs. The problem
    is that if one wants to "update" a node, it's still very hard to update
    how other nodes re-generate the current node at the same time.
    The best way to do it is to build one function that maps the
    underlying structure of the type vertex to a graph (for instance,
    a concrete data structure, or an URL...). *)
